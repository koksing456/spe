# Introduction



This project is an interactive simulation of the Stanford Prison Experiment, implemented as a web application. It provides users with a deep understanding of the psychological dynamics that emerged during the original 1971 experiment.

## Overview

The Stanford Prison Experiment Simulation allows users to explore and understand the psychological effects of perceived power through an interactive interface. The simulation recreates the environment and conditions of the original experiment, using AI to generate realistic interactions between guards and prisoners.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Simulation

* Dynamic day/night cycle with 4-hour updates
* Interactive timeline showing experiment progression
* Live interaction feed with AI-generated responses
* Stress level monitoring and incident tracking

### 2. Role-Based Interactions

* AI-powered guard responses with varying authority levels
* Prisoner interactions showing psychological adaptation
* Observer and psychologist insights
* Dr. Zimbardo's narration of events

### 3. Visual Analytics

* Prison layout map showing facility structure
* Relationship dynamics visualization
* Stress level indicators and trends
* Incident tracking and analysis

### 4. Psychological Monitoring

* Real-time stress level assessment
* Behavioral pattern analysis
* Incident classification and severity tracking
* Relationship dynamic mapping

## How It Works

### Simulation Engine

The simulation runs on a sophisticated AI engine that:

1. Generates realistic interactions between participants
2. Tracks and updates stress levels
3. Creates and logs incidents
4. Analyzes behavioral patterns
5. Updates relationship dynamics

### Time Progression

* The simulation runs on a compressed timeline
* Each day is divided into 4-hour segments
* Events and interactions occur based on the time of day
* The environment changes to reflect day/night cycles

### Participant Roles

#### Guards

* Equipped with authority tools and uniforms
* Can issue commands and maintain order
* Stress levels affect their behavior
* Interactions logged and analyzed

#### Prisoners

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Assigned numbers and basic clothing
* Must follow guard instructions
* Stress levels impact compliance
* Behavioral changes tracked

#### Staff

* Dr. Zimbardo (Lead Researcher)
* Psychologists
* Observers
* All monitoring and documenting events

### Monitoring Systems

#### Incident Logging

* Behavioral incidents
* Conflicts
* Resistance events
* Compliance records

#### Stress Analysis

* Real-time stress level monitoring
* Individual and group stress patterns
* Environmental impact assessment
* Intervention triggers

#### Relationship Mapping

* Guard-prisoner dynamics
* Inter-group relationships
* Power structure visualization
* Alliance and conflict tracking

## Research Value

This simulation provides valuable insights into:

* Power dynamics in institutional settings
* Psychological effects of authority
* Group behavior under stress
* Social hierarchy formation
* Ethical considerations in authority structures
