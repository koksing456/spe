# AI System Documentation

This document explains how the AI system powers the Stanford Prison Experiment simulation, creating realistic interactions and behavioral patterns.

## System Overview

The simulation uses a sophisticated AI system to:
1. Generate realistic participant behaviors
2. Manage dynamic interactions
3. Track psychological states
4. Analyze behavioral patterns
5. Create emergent social dynamics

## AI Agents

### Guard Agent
The guard agent simulates prison guard behavior:
- Autonomously decides how to approach authority role
- Balances order maintenance with humane treatment
- Responds to prisoner behavior and stress levels
- Develops individual personality traits
- Makes decisions based on:
  - Current stress levels
  - Recent incidents
  - Time of day
  - Overall experiment progression

### Prisoner Agent
The prisoner agent simulates prisoner responses:
- Adapts to confinement conditions
- Shows varying levels of compliance
- Develops coping mechanisms
- Interacts with other prisoners
- Responds to guard authority

### Psychologist Agent
Monitors and analyzes participant behavior:
- Evaluates psychological states
- Identifies concerning patterns
- Recommends interventions
- Provides professional insights
- Documents behavioral changes

### Narrator Agent (Dr. Zimbardo)
Provides experiment oversight:
- Describes ongoing events
- Explains psychological implications
- Makes research observations
- Guides experiment progression
- Intervenes when necessary
