# Stanford Prison Experiment with AI

## Introduction

In August of 1971, Professor Philip Zimbardo began an investigation into the power dynamics that exist between guards and inmates in a prison setting. The object of the Stanford prison experiment was to determine if it was the acquisition of power that made guards turn brutal or whether brutality was actually intrinsic to human nature itself.

The notorious experiment that ensued would kick off decades of academic controversy and suggests some very dark things about the nature of humanity. Today, we're going to take a look at why the Stanford prison experiment might be the most disturbing study ever conducted.

During the 1970s, both the US Navy and Marine Corps were interested in learning about the hierarchies of power in military prisons. Accordingly, the US Office of Naval Research issued Philip Zimbardo a grant to study the relationships between prison guards and prisoners. The objective would be to determine if those relationships were shaped more by the prison environment or the personalities of the guards. The grant would be used to create a mock prison environment in which to conduct the experiment and to pay the participants.

### Recruitment Process

The Stanford prison experiment started with an ad Zimbardo placed in the classifieds. It read, "Male college students needed for psychological study of prison life. $15 per day for 1-2 weeks." 70 people applied.

The applicants were interviewed and asked to take personality tests. Anyone who had a criminal record or record of abusing narcotics was eliminated, as was anyone who displayed personality disorders, physical disabilities, or psychological problems. Ultimately, 24 college students, all white and all male were selected to participate. And they had no idea what they were getting themselves into.

### Experimental Setup

Zimbardo and his team randomly divided the students into two groups, prisoners and guards. There were 12 of each category, 9 that were active participants and 3 that were alternates.

On August 17, 1971, the experiment began when the 9 prisoners were arrested by actual police officers from the Palo Alto Police Department. Each person was taken into custody, then had their mug shots taken before being fingerprinted, blindfolded, and moved into a holding cell. Finally, they were taken into a mock prison that had been set up in the basement of Stanford's Jordan Hall.

### Prison Environment

The fake prison felt very real. The researchers who created it had consulted with prison officials and ex-convicts before designing it. The cells were built in a space that was normally used as a laboratory. Each cell had a bar door, a cell number, and room for three prisoners. Other touches included a solitary confinement cell that had been created in a closet and a rule that prisoners had to be blindfolded before being taken to the bathroom.

To avoid selection bias, participants were assigned to be either prisoners or guards based on the results of a coin toss. Very different fates awaited each respective group:

#### Guards

- Given real prison guard uniforms
- Equipped with nightsticks and whistles
- Many wore mirrored sunglasses to prevent eye contact with prisoners

#### Prisoners

- Stripped and deloused
- Dressed in ill-fitting numbered smocks and sandals
- No underwear provided
- Given nylon stocking caps instead of head shaving
- Chains placed on their legs
- Addressed only by their numbers
